      <description>LC 1041 Robot Bounded in Circle 
 On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. The robot can receive one of three instructions:
 &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;: go straight 1 unit; &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;: turn 90 degrees to the left; &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;: turn 90 degress to the right.  The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.
Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.</description>

      <description>LC 957 Prison Cells 
 There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.
Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:
 If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied. Otherwise, it becomes vacant.  (Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can&amp;rsquo;t have two adjacent neighbors.</description>

      <description>LC 735 Aseroid Collision 
 We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.
For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode.</description>

      <description>LC 1266
 On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.
You can move according to the next rules:
 In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second). You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.</description>
